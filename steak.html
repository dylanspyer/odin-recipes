      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Steak. It's delicious. It's nutritious. If you only ate steak, you'd
        probably live longer.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
        <li>Love</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Oil the pan</li>
        <li>
          Throw that puppy on (I'm referring to your steak, don't hurt your
          actual puppy!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook it till it's done method doesn't work as well for steak as it
          does for fried rice. There's a little more science to it. Use a meat
          thermometer. I know, I know, I'm such an aristocrat.
        </li>
